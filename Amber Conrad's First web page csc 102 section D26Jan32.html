    <h1>Amber's First Website</h1>
    <title>My First Webpage</title>
    <h2>
        <span style="color: blue;">Welcome to my webpage!</span>
    </h2> 
    <p>This is my first attempt at creating a webpage. I'm excited to learn more about HTML and web development!
        <br>
        My name is Amber, and I enjoy exploring new technologies and creative hobbies. I am 21 years old as of Febuary 26th, 2026.

        My favorite quote is,
         "We all change, when you think about it. We're all different people; all through our lives, and that's okay,
         <br>
         that's good, you've gotta keep moving, so long as you remember all the people that you used to be." - Matt Smith.
